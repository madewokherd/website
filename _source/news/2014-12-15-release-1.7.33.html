Title: Release 1.7.33
Date: Mon, 15 Dec 2014

<p>We just released the updated patchset for Wine 1.7.33. Besides the 29 bugs fixed upstream since the last release, we have added about 14 additional bug fixes to Wine Staging. You can take a look at the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/v1.7.33/debian/changelog">changelog</a> for the full list of changes. There is one feature I would like to point out since it was requested a lot by our users: CSMT (command stream multithreaded) support.</p>

<p>Although originally announced by Codeweavers employee Stefan DÃ¶singer about a year ago, there still wasn't much progress with upstreaming these patches. We were hesitating to add these patches in the past because they are known to have a negative effect for some apps. Thanks to the newly introduced <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/DLL-Redirects">dll redirection scheme</a> it was possible to add it anyway, by providing a CSMT and a non-CSMT version of wined3d. In order to test the CSMT feature, it is sufficient to enable it in <code>winecfg</code> - take a look <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/DLL-Redirects">here</a> for instructions how to do that.</p>
