	<p>Wine Staging is an open source project licensed under the LGPL2 license (with some exceptions, see <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/blob/master/LICENSE.md">here</a>). The source code is currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. In order to build Wine Staging you'll additionally need upstream Wine. Detailed instructions how to build Wine Staging are available in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Packaging">packaging instructions</a>.

	<h3 class="title">Contributing</h2>

	<p>We are also happy about contributions. If you for example spend a lot of time figuring out how to solve a specific issue, but have trouble with your patch getting accepted upstream, then we can also take a look at it and will add it if it passes our review. We will not accept hacks for single applications and all patches must at least have a minimum standard quality. If your patch does not fulfill these quality guidelines, we will tell you about these problems, to give you the possibility to correct them. We are open for all other kind of patches and in contrast to upstream Wine, we also accept bigger work-in-progress patchsets. You can find more about this in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Development">wiki</a>.</p>
